I have used the concept of Arrays, Objects and functions in JavaScript to create this automation.üë©‚Äçüíª
Meadowfield consists of 11 places and 14 roads between them which willbe the world that the mail delivery robot moves through.
Those 11 places are:
1)Alice's House
2)Bob's House
3)Cabin
4)Post Office
5)Town Hall
6)Daria's House
7)Ernies House
8)Grete's House
9)Farm
10)Shop
11)Market-place
The 14 roads can be described using an array:
const roads = [
"Alice;s House-Bob's House", "Alice's House-Cabin",
"Alice's House-Post office", "Bob's House-Town Hall",
"Daria's House-Ernie's House", "Daria's House-Town Hall"
"Ernies House-Grete's House", "Grete's House-Farm",
"Grete's House-Shop", "Marketplace-Farm"
"Marketplace-Town Hall", "Shop-Town Hall"
],
